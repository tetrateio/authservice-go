# Mock e2e tests

The `mock` e2e test suite contains tests that use the `mock` OIDC provider.
The suite is mostly used to verify the correct behavior of the different configuration
options without making real requests to an OIDC provider.

It can be used for rapid prorotyping and development of new features.
